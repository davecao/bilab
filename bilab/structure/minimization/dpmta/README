This is the README file for DPMTA.

Most all of the information about compiling and installing DPMTA
is contained in the Users Guide in the 'doc' directory.

All questions and problem reports should be emailed to the PMTA
mailing list at: pmta@ee.duke.edu.

Sources may be found through the DPMTA Web page at:

of via anon ftp at:

================================================================

A couple notes on building DPMTA.

DPMTA was developed using the Gnu version of 'make'.  Some other
version of the make utility do not contain the implicit rules from
going from a bunch of object files to a complete executable.  Thus
they will not generate the final linking steps of the build process.

See the README.HPPA file for more details.


================================================================

The 'fortran' directory.

At the request of another user, I have thrown together some initial
examples of how to get DPMTA running under a FORTRAN environment.
These pieces of code are untested and unsupported.

Use at your own risk.


================================================================

Test Programs.

I have moved the DPMTA example programs to their own directory
contained in "./test/" .  They are still automatically build during
the normal installation process.
